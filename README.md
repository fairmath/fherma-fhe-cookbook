# Contributing to the FHERMA Cookbook

## What is the FHERMA Cookbook?

The **FHERMA Cookbook** is an academic, community-maintained resource focused on the **application layer of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.  

  

This repository contains the source files for the book, which is periodically compiled and updated on [IACR ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1302). Every accepted contribution will be included in the next published version, and all contributors will be added as co-authors.
